THE COMPUTER ENGINE ALGORITHM

----------------------------
The Highest level algorithm
----------------------------

* The computer is indicated by simbol "C" and the user with "U"

If C can realize a tris
	C do it
Else if the U has performed a bis
	C block it
Else if C can do a bis
	C do it
Else
	C chooses a casual box to be filled
